# LearnTree - Consolidate learning materials into one platform

## Overview

LearnTree is a web application designed to help users consolidate and organise their learning materials. With LearnTree, users can create a tree-like structure that contain leaves. Leaves are folders created by the user to keep track of what they want to learn, such as data types or Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Users can add articles, books, online courses, and other resources to these leaves, making it easy to manage and access learning materials in one place.

## Features

### 1. Tree-like Structure

- **Leaves:** Leaves are folders that contain links to resources such as articles, books, or online courses. Users can add new leaves, and this forms the overarching learning tree which gives a high level of what the user is learning.

### 2. Progress Tracking

- LearnTree helps users keep track of their learning progress. Users can mark leaves as completed, allowing them to see which topics they have mastered and which ones require more attention.
- A visual progress bar provides a quick overview of their overall learning progress, and the completion of individual resources within leaves contributes to this progress.

### 3. Collaboration

- Users can connect with their colleagues and see what topics they are currently learning. This feature encourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the discovery of new resources.

## Installation

LearnTree is currently still in development. Installation steps will be added soon.

## Usage

1. Create an account or log in if you already have one.
2. Explore the interface. This consists of 'Home', 'My Pathway', 'Peers', and 'My Profile'.
3. Create your first leaf to represent a topic you would like to learn.
4. Add learning resources to this leaf by clicking into it and pasting a link to your chosen resource.
5. As you tick an item, such as a book, as completed, this will increment the progress bar at the top of the page and can also be seen on the leaf itself.
6. Once every resource within a leaf is completed, return to the learning tree and watch as the leaf changes colour to green.
7. Connect with peers and check out what they are currently learning.
8. Enjoy the journey of LearnTree as your tree continues to grow and change colour showing how far you've come.
